# Contributing Code

## Expectations

When submitting a merge request the developer is expected to have done
a due diligence effort to ensure the code submitted will not break the
build or add undue burden on other developers. To do this there are
certain actions developers should do before submitting code for review.

* full project builds on at least one platform
```bash
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..
# cmake --build .
```
* project build does not have any known fails (i.e. it is not sufficient
to have a platform where the builds pass if the developer knows of a
system where build fails)
* Unit tests pass
```bash
# vpl-utest
```
* An effort has been made to ensure content checked in align to the style
guides in this document.
